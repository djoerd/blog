The Dutch chapter of ISOC asked the great Anne Stalinksi to make a
cartoon of Searsia.
Translated to English, the cartoon says: "Searsia allows users to search
sources that Google cannot use".
The user enters the query "How to bake a quiche?", and Searsia not only
searches the "Internet", but
also the infamous "grandma's cookbook" and "sundry".
