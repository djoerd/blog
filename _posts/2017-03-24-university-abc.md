Last week we launched our [software for query autocompletions][1]: Type
in the first character of your query, and Searsia will recommend a query
that best completes your prefix. The autocompletions are targeted to the
users of the search engine, without the need to track those users.
Searsia's autocompletions are demonstrated by [UT Search][2], the search
engine for the University of Twente. Today, using the autocompletions
for each letter, we present a university's autcompletion ABC:
